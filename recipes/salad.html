    <h2>Everyday Salad</h2>
    <p>
      My favorite “everyday” salad recipe is quick and easy to make, tossed with
      a simple and delicious lemony dressing, and so versatile that it goes with
      just about everything!

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

      <li>5 ounces spring greens mix (or any salad greens you prefer)</li>

      <li>half of an English cucumber, very thinly sliced</li>

      <li>half of a medium red onion, peeled and very thinly sliced</li>

      <li>
        1/2 cup pepitas or toasted pine nuts (or any other nuts or seeds you
        prefer)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        To Make The Dressing: Whisk all ingredients together in a bowl (or shake
        together in a mason jar) until combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        To Make The Salad: Combine all ingredients in a large salad bowl and
